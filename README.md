# Quantum Book Store

A simple Java-based extensible online bookstore system that supports:

- Paper Books (shipped to an address)
- EBooks (sent via email)
- Showcase Books (not for sale)

All books support standard attributes like ISBN, title, year, price, and author. The system can:
- Add books
- Remove outdated books
- Buy books by ISBN
- Handle book-specific behavior (shipping, emailing, restricted sale)

---

## üß† Object-Oriented Design

- `Book`: Base class for all book types.
- `PaperBook`, `EBook`, `ShowcaseBook`: Extend `Book` with specific behavior.
- `Inventory`: Manages book operations (add, buy, remove outdated).
- `MailService` & `ShippingService`: Simulate external service calls.
- `QuantumBookstore`: Main class to test all features.
